# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Classifier
Brain Tumor MRI Classifier – An AI-powered tool to classify brain tumors from MRI scans into Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, or No Tumor using DenseNet121 and a Gradio web interface.

I was initially working on a medical chatbot, but due to time constraints during exams, I focused on this project first. I am actively researching my next project and will upload it soon.

This repo includes the trained model, training notebook, and Gradio app to try predictions locally or deploy online.

due to size issues i uploaded the model on drive -
